# This project config file describes all *project-specific variables*
# Its primary purpose as as input to Looper, which will submit jobs as appropriate
# for each sample in the project.
# But it is also read by other tools, including:
# - project sample loop (primary purpose)
# - make_trackhubs scripts to produce web accessible results
# - stats summary scripts
# - analysis scripts requiring pointers to metadata, results, and other options.

paths:
  # output_dir: ABSOLUTE PATH to the parent, shared space where project results go
  output_dir: /scratch/lab_bock/shared/projects/crop-seq
  # results and submission subdirs are subdirectors directories under parent output_dir
  # results: where output sample folders will go
  # submission: where cluster submit scripts and log files will go
  results_subdir: results_pipeline
  submission_subdir: submission
  # pipelines_dir: ABSOLUTE PATH the directory where the Looper will find pipeline
  # scripts (and accompanying pipeline config files) for submission.
  pipelines_dir: /home/arendeiro/workspace/open_pipelines

metadata:
  # Elements in this section can be absolute or relative.
  # Typically, this project config file is stored with the project metadata, so
  # relative paths are considered relative to this project config file.
  # sample_annotation: one-row-per-sample metadata
  sample_annotation: annotation.csv
  # merge_table: input for samples with more than one input file
  merge_table: merge_table.csv
  # compare_table: comparison pairs or groups, like normalization samples
  compare_table: null.csv

data_sources:
  # specify the ABSOLUTE PATH of input files using variable path expressions
  # entries correspond to values in the data_source column in sample_annotation table
  # {variable} can be used to replace environment variables or other sample_annotation columns
  # If you use {variable} codes, you should quote the field so python can parse it.
  bsf_samples: "/scratch/lab_bsf/samples/{flowcell}/{flowcell}_{lane}_samples/{flowcell}_{lane}#{BSF_name}.bam"

genomes:
  human: hg38_spiked
  humanmouse: hg19_mm10_transgenes

transcriptomes:
  human: hg38
  humanmouse: hg19_mm10_transgenes

compute:
  # submission_template: the submission form which will be replaced with compute resource parameters
  # Use this to change your cluster manager (SLURM, SGE, LFS, etc)
  # Relative paths are relative to the pipelines_dir
  submission_template: templates/slurm_template.sub
  submission_command: sbatch
  # To run on the localhost:
  #submission_template: templates/localhost_template.sub
  #submission_command: sh


pipeline_config:
  # pipeline configuration files used in project.
  # Relative paths are relative to this project config file.
  # Default (null) means use the generic config for the pipeline.
  dropseq.py: null
  # Or you can point to a specific config to be used in this project:
  # chipseq: chipseq_pipeline.yaml

trackhubs:
  trackhub_dir: /scratch/lab_bock/shared/projects/crop-seq/trackhubs
  # url: if you include this, the make_trackhubs will produce a link to your track hub in the project folder.
